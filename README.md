This project explores global poverty and income inequality through a dataset from the Cross-National Data Center in Luxembourg. The dataset includes key indicators such as the Gini Coefficient and Atkinson Coefficients, which measure income inequality, along with percentile ratios (e.g., 90/10, 90/50) to examine income distribution across different population segments. It focuses on relative poverty rates for the total population, children, and the elderly, measured at various thresholds (40%, 50%, 60% of median income), providing insights into poverty levels across different demographic groups.

Additionally, the project investigates the distribution of children by income groups and compares poverty rates in two-parent versus single-mother families, shedding light on family structure's role in economic inequality. Median and mean equivalized incomes are also analyzed to understand income disparities across various groups. By combining these measures, the study aims to highlight patterns of global inequality and poverty, especially among vulnerable populations like children and the elderly.

The insights gained are intended to support policymakers, researchers, and organizations in creating informed strategies to reduce poverty and address income inequality worldwide.
